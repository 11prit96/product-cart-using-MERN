In a rush of things, I forgot I had to integrate with mongoose. The app was working completely fine but after connecting with mongoose at 3:20 p.m, the proxy suddenly stoped working. I had to submit before 4 p.m, so I switched back to non async controllers in my server logic. But for some reason, the proxy isnt working now. And there's no time to grt it right now. Please would you consider looking at my code. I took all the time write it all from scratch. No copying from anywhere, and now its not working. Please check the code, the code is alright. It was working. Just stopped working 30 mins ago. I wish I had more time to correct it.
